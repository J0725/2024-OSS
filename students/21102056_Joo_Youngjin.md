# Summary
Psych: North Korea claimed on Wednesday that South Korea had infiltrated Pyongyang and sprayed North Korean leaflets, calling it an "unforgivable grave provocation." At the same time, it warned that if the Republic of Korea commits such provocations again, they will be immediately taken into action rather than such a warning. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff refuted North Korea's claim that the South Korean military had not sent drones to the North.
# Opinion
In my opinion,I don't think the South Korean military made the same provocation as sending drones.
However, I think North Korea has put up a psychological battle for another provocation.
