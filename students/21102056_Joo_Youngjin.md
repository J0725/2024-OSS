Number of Pages of article: 1(internet article)

Summarize: North Korea accused South Korea of infiltrating Pyongyang and distributing anti-North Korean leaflets, calling it a serious provocation. It warned of immediate action if similar incidents occur again. However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff denied the claim, stating that no drones were sent to the North.

Opinion: In my opinion,I don't think the South Korean military made the same provocation as sending drones, but I think North Korea has put up a psychological battle for another provocation.
