#Summarize 
North Korea accused South Korea of infiltrating Pyongyang and distributing leaflets, calling it a grave provocation, and warned of immediate action if it happens again. However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff denied the accusations, stating no drones were sent.

#Opinion 
In my opinion,I don't think the South Korean military made the same provocation as sending drones, but I think North Korea has put up a psychological battle for another provocation.
